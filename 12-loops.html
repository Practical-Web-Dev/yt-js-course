    /*
    
    - Loops in JavaScript and programming in general allow you to run a set of instructions that is repeated until a specific goal or condition is reached.
   
    - Loops allow you to run one block of code instead of writing several lines of code to achieve the same outcome

    //Basic Syntax of a for loop
    //    START           FINISH       STEP SIZE
    for (let count = 1; count <= 11; count += 1) {

      console.log(count)

    //Challenge 
    //Create a for loop that counts from 1 to 20. Look at the examples above to check your syntax

    //Challenge 
    //Create a for loop that logs out all of the numbers in the array. Remember to use .length

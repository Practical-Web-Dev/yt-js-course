    - In JavaScript and most other programming languages, text and sentances are called strings.
   
    - Strings are wrapped in either double "" or single quotes ''
   
    Example 1 - const myString = "This is my string"
    
    Example 2 - const myString = 'This is my string'
   
   
    */

    //Single quote string
    const singleQuote = 'This is a single quote string'
    console.log(singleQuote)


    //Challenge - Create a string in either double or single quotes that is assgined to a variable named myGoal. Write a sentence that describes your number 1 goal in life and log myGoal to the console.

    const myGoal = 'My number 1 goal in life is to provide for my family'
    console.log(myGoal)

    /*
 
 
  Escaping characters
 
  - Sometimes you will need to write strings in JS that contain quotes and or apostrophes in the text which can break your code. You can get around this by using double quotes for strings that use apostophes, single quotes for text that will uses quotation marks. 
 
  - You can also escape characters using a back slash \

    let apostrophe = "It's a beautiful day"
